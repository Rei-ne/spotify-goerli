This repo contains my solidity smart contract, compiled with [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/tutorial) and deployed with [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/) and [alchemy](https://docs.alchemy.com/) web3

## Frontend

Frontend built with react + vite

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

### Starting the frontend

- git clone the folder from github
- open the folder with vs code to get started

```
npm install

cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
